The Agent Client Protocol (ACP) is a protocol that standardizes communication between code editors (interactive programs for viewing and editing source code) and coding agents (programs that use generative AI to autonomously modify code).

The protocol is still under heavy development, and we aim to standardize it as we get confidence in the design by implementing it in various settings.

## Why ACP?

AI coding agents and editors are tightly coupled but interoperability isn't the default. Each editor must build custom integrations for every agent they want to support, and agents must implement editor-specific APIs to reach users.
This creates several problems:

- Integration overhead: Every new agent-editor combination requires custom work
- Limited compatibility: Agents work with only a subset of available editors
- Developer lock-in: Choosing an agent often means accepting their available interfaces

ACP solves this by providing a standardized protocol for agent-editor communication, similar to how LSP standardized language server integration. Agents that implement ACP work with any compatible editor. Editors that support ACP gain access to the entire ecosystem of ACP-compatible agents.
This decoupling allows both sides to innovate independently while giving developers the freedom to choose the best tools for their workflow.

## Overview

The protocol is newline-delimited JSON sent over stdin/stdout. When a code editor wants to start a session with an agent, it boots it as a sub-process (inheriting any environment variables) and sends an initialize request to get the state of the world.

If authentication is required, it can send authenticate to allow the agent to perform any authentication actions (like an Oauth flow).

Once the agent is ready, the client can send sendUserMessage requests with content from the user. The agent sends streamAssistantMessageChunk and related tool call messages to update the UI while handling the user's message, and finally responds when there will be no more output.
