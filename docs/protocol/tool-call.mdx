Tool Calls represent the invocation of tools by [Agents](./overview#agent) during conversation sessions. The Agent Client Protocol provides a structured way to track tool execution, report progress, and handle results.

## Overview

Tool Calls are the mechanism through which Agents interact with external tools and services. Each tool call has a unique identifier and can be tracked through its entire lifecycle - from invocation through completion.
