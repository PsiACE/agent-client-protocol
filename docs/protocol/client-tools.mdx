description: "Tools available to agents for interacting with the client"
---

Client tools provide agents with enhanced capabilities to interact with the client environment. These tools are optional and can be configured when creating or loading a session.

## Overview

Client tools extend agent functionality by providing controlled access to:
- User permission requests
- File system operations (read/write)

## Available Tools

### Request Permission

The request permission tool allows agents to request user authorization before performing sensitive operations.

**Tool ID Configuration:**
```json
{
  "request_permission": {
    "mcp_server": "your-mcp-server",
    "tool_name": "permission-tool-name"
  }
}
```

**Permission Options:**
- `AllowOnce` - Grant permission for a single use
- `AllowAlways` - Grant permission permanently for this type of operation
- `RejectOnce` - Deny permission for a single use
- `RejectAlways` - Deny permission permanently for this type of operation

### Write Text File

Enables agents to write content to files in the client's file system.

**Tool ID Configuration:**
```json
{
  "write_text_file": {
    "mcp_server": "your-mcp-server",
    "tool_name": "write-file-tool-name"
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `session_id` - Current session identifier
- `path` - File path to write to
- `content` - Text content to write

### Read Text File

Allows agents to read file contents from the client's file system.

**Tool ID Configuration:**
```json
{
  "read_text_file": {
    "mcp_server": "your-mcp-server",
    "tool_name": "read-file-tool-name"
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `session_id` - Current session identifier
- `path` - File path to read from
- `line` (optional) - Specific line number to start reading from
- `limit` (optional) - Maximum number of lines to read

## Configuration

Client tools are configured as part of the session initialization:

```json
{
  "client_tools": {
    "request_permission": {
      "mcp_server": "client-tools-server",
      "tool_name": "request_permission"
    },
    "write_text_file": {
      "mcp_server": "client-tools-server",
      "tool_name": "write_file"
    },
    "read_text_file": {
      "mcp_server": "client-tools-server",
      "tool_name": "read_file"
    }
  }
}
```

All client tools are optional. Only include the tools you want to make available to the agent.

## Security Considerations

- All file operations require explicit session context
- Permission requests provide granular control over agent actions
- Users can choose between one-time and persistent permissions
- File paths are relative to the configured working directory

## Implementation Notes

- Each tool requires a valid `session_id` to maintain context
- Tools are referenced via `McpToolId` containing the MCP server name and tool name
- Permission outcomes can be either `Canceled` or `Selected` with the chosen option
