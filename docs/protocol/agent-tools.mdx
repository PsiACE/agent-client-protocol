Agents have access to a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with codebases, performing searches, making edits, and accessing external resources. The Agent Client Protocol standardizes how these tools are described and how their usage is communicated between agents and clients.

## Overview

Agent tools are organized into two main categories:
- **Read & Search Tools**: For exploring and understanding codebases
- **Edit Tools**: For modifying files and project structure

Each tool is designed with specific use cases in mind and follows consistent patterns for input and output.

## Read & Search Tools

### diagnostics

Gets errors and warnings for either a specific file or the entire project. This tool is particularly useful after making edits to verify that changes haven't introduced new issues.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (optional) - Specific file to analyze, or omit for project-wide summary

### fetch

Fetches a URL and returns the content as Markdown. This tool enables agents to access documentation, API references, and other web resources.

**Parameters:**
- `url` - The URL to fetch

### find_path

Quickly finds files by matching glob patterns. Returns matching file paths sorted alphabetically.

**Parameters:**
- `pattern` - Glob pattern to match (e.g., `**/*.js`, `src/**/*.ts`)

### grep

Searches file contents across the project using regular expressions. This is the preferred tool for finding symbols, functions, or specific code patterns when you don't know the exact file location.

**Parameters:**
- `regex` - Regular expression pattern to search for
- `include_pattern` (optional) - Glob pattern to limit search scope

### list_directory

Lists files and directories in a given path, providing an overview of the filesystem structure.

**Parameters:**
- `path` - Directory path to list

### now

Returns the current date and time in the system's timezone.

### open

Opens a file or URL with the default application associated with it on the user's operating system.

**Parameters:**
- `path` or `url` - Resource to open

### read_file

Reads the content of a specified file in the project.

**Parameters:**
- `path` - File path to read
- `start_line` (optional) - Line to start reading from
- `end_line` (optional) - Line to stop reading at

### thinking

Allows the agent to work through problems, brainstorm ideas, or plan without executing actions. This tool is useful for complex problem-solving and planning multi-step operations.

**Parameters:**
- `content` - The problem or idea to think through

### web_search

Searches the web for information, providing results with snippets and links from relevant web pages.

**Parameters:**
- `query` - Search query

## Edit Tools

### copy_path

Copies a file or directory recursively in the project. This is more efficient than manually reading and writing files when duplicating content.

**Parameters:**
- `source` - Path to copy from
- `destination` - Path to copy to

### create_directory

Creates a new directory at the specified path within the project, including all necessary parent directories (similar to `mkdir -p`).

**Parameters:**
- `path` - Directory path to create

### create_file

Creates a new file at a specified path with given text content. This is the most efficient way to create new files or completely replace existing ones.

**Parameters:**
- `path` - File path to create
- `content` - Text content for the file

### delete_path

Deletes a file or directory (including contents recursively) at the specified path.

**Parameters:**
- `path` - Path to delete

### edit_file

Edits files by replacing specific text with new content. This tool enables precise modifications without rewriting entire files.

**Parameters:**
- `path` - File to edit
- `old_text` - Text to replace
- `new_text` - Replacement text

### move_path

Moves or renames a file or directory in the project. If the source and destination are in the same directory with different names, this performs a rename.

**Parameters:**
- `source` - Current path
- `destination` - New path

### terminal

Executes shell commands and returns the combined output. Each invocation creates a new shell process.

**Parameters:**
- `command` - Shell command to execute
- `cwd` (optional) - Working directory for the command

**Important Notes:**
- Don't use for long-running processes (servers, watchers)
- Each invocation is a fresh shell session
- Output is automatically displayed to the user
