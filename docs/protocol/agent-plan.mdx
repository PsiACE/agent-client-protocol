Agent plans represent high-level execution strategies that language models create when processing complex user requests. When an LLM needs to break down a task into multiple steps—like refactoring code, analyzing systems, or performing multi-stage operations—it generates a plan that the Agent shares with the Client for transparency.

Agents report plans through [`session/update`](./prompt-turn#3-agent-reports-output) notifications, allowing Clients to display the Agent's thinking process and progress to users in real-time.

Plans help users understand what the Agent intends to do, providing visibility into complex operations before and during execution.

## Creating

When the language model creates an execution plan, the Agent **SHOULD** report it to the Client:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "plan",
      "entries": [
        {
          "content": "Analyze the existing codebase structure",
          "priority": "high",
          "status": "pending"
        },
        {
          "content": "Identify components that need refactoring",
          "priority": "high",
          "status": "pending"
        },
        {
          "content": "Create unit tests for critical functions",
          "priority": "medium",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="entries" type="PlanEntry[]" required>
  An array of [plan entries](#plan-entries) representing the tasks to be accomplished
</ParamField>

## Updating

As the Agent progresses through the plan, it sends more `session/update` notifications with the same structure.

The Agent **MUST** send a complete list of all plan entries in each update and their current status. The Client **MUST** replace the current plan completely.

### Dynamic Planning

Plans can evolve during execution. The Agent **MAY** add, remove, or modify plan entries as it discovers new requirements or completes tasks, allowing it to adapt based on what it learns.

## Plan Entries

Each plan entry represents a specific task or goal within the overall execution strategy:

<ParamField path="content" type="string" required>
  A human-readable description of what this task aims to accomplish
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="priority" type="PlanEntryPriority" required>
  The relative importance of this task.

  - `high`
  - `medium`
  - `low`

  Priorities help Clients visually distinguish between essential and optional tasks, allowing users to understand which parts of the plan are most critical.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="status" type="PlanEntryStatus" required>
  The current [execution status](#status) of this task

  - `pending`
  - `in_progress`
  - `completed`
</ParamField>
