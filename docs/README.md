# ACP Documentation

The ACP documentation uses [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/).
All files are MDX and can host custom components if there's a need to.

## Running

Run the following command to have the documentation live locally:

```bash
npm run docs
```
## Preview changes locally
To preview the changes locally, run the following command:
```bash
mint dev
```

### Install the CLI
Before running the site locally you need to install Mint's CLI:
```bash
npm i -g mint
```

## Deployment

The documentation site is updated every time changes get to `main`.
