# ACP Documentation

The ACP documentation uses [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/).
All files are MDX and can host custom components if there's a need to.

## Running

Run the following command to have the documentation live locally:

```bash
npm run docs
```

## Deployment

The documentation site is updated every time changes get to `main`.
